What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 That learned about the Y-sort node and how it sorts child nodes base on position.

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 It's about a bunch of bees trying to figure out where the beekeeper went. They find out they were take to a hospital, I'm assuming
he caught the virus.  

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

 I'll probably use the Y-sort node to keep thing more organized.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 Turn down the music a bit. It was just a little too loud

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 I was thrown off by how there are only two scripts, until I realized every interactible object/character share the same one

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 Yes, each person's job was listed in the repository and all were preformed adequately

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes.

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Explain what BL-MSCH-C220 stands for. People not in the class will see it and not know what that means.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

I really like the sound effects and overall sound quality.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
